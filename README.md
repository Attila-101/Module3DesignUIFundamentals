## White space

White space is nothing. In fact it might not even be white. White space is the space that surrounds the content. We can categorize white spaces into two groups, micro & macro and passive & active. Space between small elements like letters can be referred to as micro white space. the space between bigger elements like text columns is the macro white space group. Paddings and margins also fall into this group.

## Alignment

The arrangement of elements on the page is called alignment. This principle can be put into two categories. One category is the edge alignment in which case the content is on either edge of the container that holds the element. The elements can be placed on the right, left, top, or the bottom of the page as long as everything is kept on the edge. The second category is the center alignment. In this category the content is placed in the center.

## Contrast

It establishes hierarchy in the design to show which elements are the most significant by directing the focus of the audience. Contrast can be applied in many parts of the design, few examples include contrast in shape, contrast in color, contrast in scale, contrast in layout, contrast in type.

## Color

Our eyes interpret different wavelengths of light as different colors. The are primary and secondary colors. Primary colors are called primary because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. Primary colors are red, yellow and blue. If we mix the primary colors you get the secondary colors which are green, orange and purple. Finally, if we mix primary colors with secondary colors we get tertiary colors. The tertiary colors are red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, blue-violet, and red-violet. It is also important to mention that colors have three main properties such as hue, value and intensity. To help us navigate the relationship between colors we can use a color wheel. With color we can create identity, express emotions and messages.

## Scale

It shows how the size of one object relates to the other or the space itself. Scale of an object can be understood only if it is seen in comparison to another object or its surrounding. Scale can provide emphasis, variety and even create motion effect.

## Proximity

Proximity is the spatial relation between elements of a design. The rule of thumb of proximity is that related items should be visually grouped together to highlight their relationship and unrelated design elements should be placed further apart to underscore their unrelatedness.

## Typography

It is the act of organizing text and letters in a manner that is readable and aesthetic. In other words, typography refers to the visual aspect of text and letters. Key elements of typography are typefaces and fonts. Typeface is the family of fonts with all the different font weights, widths, and styles. Fonts are the members of the typeface family. For example, Times New Roman is the typeface which includes the entire font family. Some of the font members of the Times New Roman typeface are the Times New Roman Bold or the Times New Roman Normal fonts.

## Visual hierarchy

It organizes design elements to show the order of their importance by using the above mentioned design fundamentals. Visual hierarchy influences the viewers in what order to view different elements of the design. Visual hierarchy helps viewers navigate the design easier. A good visual hierarchy makes interacting with the content effortless and increases the usability of the product.
